      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Chess has a long and storied history. The game has changed quite a bit
        from its earliest forms in India. The modern iteration we enjoy today
        wasn't known until the 16th century. There were no clocks, and the
        pieces were not standardized until the 19th century. The official world
        championship title came into existence by the late 19th century, shortly
        after the first big tournaments were held and multiple styles of play
        had begun to fully develop. Although the first book on openings was
        published as early as 1843, theory as we know it didn't truly evolve
        until the early/mid 20th century. Computer engines and databases didn't
        come into play until the very late 20th century.

      <h2>Magnus Carlsen</h2>
      <p>
        To many, GM Magnus Carlsen is the best to ever play the game, although
        GMs Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer remain in the conversation. At any
        rate, the clear and remarkable point is that before turning 30 years
        old, Carlsen had already earned a spot at the top, and he has continued
        to dominate into his 30s. The 13-year-old Norwegian prodigy drew
        Kasparov and defeated GM Anatoly Karpov at the same event in 2004, one
        month before he became the second-youngest GM in history (and still
        eighth-youngest as of 2021). In 2009, he became the youngest player to
        break the 2800-rating threshold (a record only broken by GM Alireza
        Firouzja in 2021). Then Carlsen transitioned from young world-class
        player to all-time great. He captured the world number-one ranking in
        2011 and still hasnâ€™t let go of it as of May 2023. He won the world
        title in 2013 and has successfully defended it four times (2014, 2016,
        2018, and 2021).
